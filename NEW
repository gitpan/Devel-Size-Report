Whats new in this version:

2005-02-27 v0.09 Tels 122 tests
  * Don't need to track simple scalars with a REFCNT of 1 in the SEEN hash,
    this reduces the memory overhead quite a bit
  * add option "track_doubles", that only tracks double/shared hash keys and
    array elemts if requested. Default is off, this saves memory.
  * Rewrote _track_size() to modify a global array instead of passing the
    results back via the stack. This avoids that the entire results array
    exists temporarily twice when returning the results and speeds up anything
    by a factor of two to three :o)
  * add a test for "Glob"
  * streamline array and hash member tracking (for simple elements)
  * streamline type()
  * add track_sizes() and hide_tracks()
