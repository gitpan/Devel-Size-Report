Whats new in this version:

2005-03-04 v0.10 Tels 145 tests
  * amend README, SYNOPSIS, example/size.pl
  * psize: support for option "d", print help if no arguments are given
  * indend => indent (Thanx Jim Cromie!)
  * sizes for array/hash refs were missing the ref itself (16 bytes on 32 bit
    systems, more on 64 bit). This also makes "[]" and "[ 1, [] ]" report
    consistent sizes for the inner array.
  * compute correct size for circular references
  * rewrote the size-gathering code to use size() instead of total_size(),
    this makes it much faster, especially for deep structures and ones with
    cycles
  * track_size() and track_sizes() also need to honor option "doubles"
  * does no longer warn about "deep recursion"
