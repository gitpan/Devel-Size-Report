Whats new in this version:

v0.04:
  * fixed the bug that sometimes looking at a scalar again after looking at
    a longer scalar reported the wrong (bigger) size. $pre = shift vs. $_[0]
    usage in total_size() was the culprit (slot reusing).  Thanx Sadahiro!
  * Size report outputs version of Devel::Size::Report, too
  * refactored tests into three files
