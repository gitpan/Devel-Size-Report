Whats new in this version:

v0.03:
  * psize: don't print out added "use" statements
  * report_size(): print overhead in %, too (Thanx nadim!)
  * knows about CODE, REGEXP, LVALUE and Scalar refs and prints them correctly
  * stop at cyclic references (e.g. don't loop forever)
  * disable Devel::Size warnings (about incomplete CV etc, thanx nadim!)
  * drop the "Key " from the output, it is rendundand
